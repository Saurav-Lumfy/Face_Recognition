### **Face Recognition**  
- **Definition**: Face recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies a person using facial features.  
- **Working Principle**: Uses machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to analyze facial landmarks and patterns.  
- **Steps Involved**:  
  1. **Face Detection** – Locating faces in images or video.  
  2. **Feature Extraction** – Identifying unique facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.).  
  3. **Face Encoding** – Converting facial features into numerical representations.  
  4. **Matching & Recognition** – Comparing the extracted features with a database to identify or verify individuals.  
- **Technologies Used**: OpenCV, Deep Learning (CNNs), Dlib, FaceNet, Microsoft Face API, etc.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Security & surveillance  
  - Smartphone unlocking  
  - Attendance systems  
  - Payment authentication  
  - Personalized advertising  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Variations in lighting, angles, and occlusions  
  - Accuracy issues with diverse demographics  
  - Privacy and ethical concerns
